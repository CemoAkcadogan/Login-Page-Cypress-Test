Cypress Test Example

This code snippet will check whether an element containing the text "GIRIS BASARILI" is visible on the page after logging in. The cy.contains() command is used to select an element that contains a specific text, and the should('be.visible') assertion checks if the element is visible.

In this way, the test scenario will verify the presence of the "GIRIS BASARILI" text on the page after performing the login operation. If the text is visible on the page, the test will pass; otherwise, it will fail.
